Is Mixed martial arts totally original from Roman Colosseum games?\nKnowledge: Alliance MMA . MMA is a full contact sport that allows a wide range of fighting techniques including, striking and grappling from various martial arts & disciplines including Boxing, Wrestling, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Karate & Muay Thai. Professional MMA fights are legal and regulated by state athletic commissions in all 50 states.\nA. yes B. no\nAnswer: First, we need to understand what mixed martial arts (MMA) is. MMA is a sport that involves various martial arts disciplines, such as boxing, wrestling, jiu-jitsu, and Muay Thai. Participants in MMA fights engage in striking and grappling techniques, attempting to defeat their opponent.\n\nNext, we need to look at the history of the Roman Colosseum games. These were gladiatorial games that took place in ancient Rome, where fighters, often slaves or prisoners, would engage in combat for the entertainment of the audience. The fighters would use swords, shields, and other weapons to defeat their opponents.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude that MMA is not totally original from the Roman Colosseum games. While both involve combat and entertainment, the fighting techniques used in MMA are very different from those used in the Colosseum. MMA incorporates a variety of martial arts disciplines, while the Colosseum games were focused on swordsmanship and gladiatorial combat. Additionally, the rules and regulations of MMA are much stricter than those of the Colosseum games, which often resulted in death or serious injury for the fighters.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (B) no. MMA is not totally original from Roman Colosseum games. So, the correct answer is B
Is the cuisine of Hawaii suitable for a vegan?\nKnowledge: Cuisine of Hawaii . The development of Hawaii regional cuisine was a coordinated effort to move away from ingredients shipped over long distances and preparations that copied continental recipes even when they were not well suited to conditions in Hawaii. Rather, the group hoped to promote locally sourced ingredients in the hospitality industry while simultaneously informing the world about cuisine in Hawaii. The goal of the group was to link local ranchers, fishermen and farmers with chefs and business in the hospitality and restaurant industry to develop Hawaii regional cuisine as a reflection of the community. They took uninspired international and continental hotel cuisine based on imported products and recipes from the mainland and replaced them with dishes and a cuisine based on locally grown foods.\nA. yes B. no\nAnswer: First, we need to gather some information about the cuisine of Hawaii. Hawaii is known for its fresh seafood, pork, and spam-based dishes, which are not suitable for a vegan diet. Many traditional dishes in Hawaii also include animal products such as eggs, dairy, and honey. Therefore, based on this information, we can conclude that the cuisine of Hawaii is not suitable for a vegan, making answer (B) the correct answer. So, the correct answer is B
Is capturing giant squid in natural habitat impossible with no gear?\nKnowledge: Giant squid . In July 2012, a crew from television networks NHK and Discovery Channel captured what they describe as "the first-ever footage of a live giant squid in its natural habitat". The footage was revealed on a NHK Special on 13 January 2013, and was shown on Discovery Channel's show "Monster Squid: The Giant Is Real" on 27 January 2013, and on "Giant Squid: Filming the Impossible – Natural World Special" on BBC Two. The squid was about long and was missing its feeding tentacles, likely from a failed attack by a sperm whale. It was drawn into viewing range by both artificial bioluminescence created to mimic panicking Atolla jellyfish and by using a "Thysanoteuthis rhombus" (diamond squid) as bait. The giant squid was filmed feeding for about 23 minutes by Tsunemi Kubodera until it departed. The technique of using unobtrusive viewing and bioluminescence luring of the squid with quiet unobtrusive platforms was described by Edith Widder, a member of the expedition.\nA. yes B. no\nAnswer: First of all, giant squid are known to inhabit very deep parts of the ocean, such as the abyssal zone, where there is immense pressure and darkness. Secondly, they are incredibly elusive and difficult to track down in the vastness of the ocean. Thirdly, capturing them would likely require specialized equipment such as submersibles or remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Without such gear, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to capture giant squid in their natural habitat. Therefore, the answer is (A) yes, capturing giant squid in natural habitat is impossible with no gear. So, the correct answer is A
Did the Royal Air Force fight in the Boxer Rebellion?\nKnowledge: Boxer Rebellion . The first reports coming from China in 1898 referred to the village activists as "Yihequan", (Wade–Giles: I Ho Ch'uan). The first known use of the term "Boxer" was September 1899 in a letter from missionary Grace Newton in Shandong. It appears from context that "Boxer" was a known term by that time, possibly coined by the Shandong missionaries Arthur H. Smith and Henry Porter. Smith says in his book of 1902 that the name I Ho Ch'uan... literally denotes the 'Fists' (Ch'uan) of Righteousness (or Public) (I) Harmony (Ho), in apparent allusion to the strength of united force which was to be put forth. As the Chinese phrase 'fists and feet' signifies boxing and wrestling, there appeared to be no more suitable term for the adherents of the sect than 'Boxers,' a designation first used by one or two missionary correspondents of foreign journals in China, and later universally accepted on account of the difficulty of coining a better one. On 6 June 1900 the "Times" of London used the term "rebellion" in quotation marks, presumably to indicate their view that the rising was in fact instigated by Empress Dowager Cixi. The historian Lanxin Xiang refers to the "so called 'Boxer Rebellion,'" and explains that "while peasant rebellion was nothing new in Chinese history, a war against the world's most powerful states was." The name "Boxer Rebellion", concludes Joseph Esherick, another recent historian, is truly a "misnomer", for the Boxers "never rebelled against the Manchu rulers of China and their Qing dynasty" and the "most common Boxer slogan, throughout the history of the movement, was "support the Qing, destroy the Foreign." He adds that only after the movement was suppressed by the Allied Intervention did both the foreign powers and influential Chinese officials realize that the Qing would have to remain as government of China in order to maintain order and collect taxes to pay the indemnity. Therefore, in order to save face for the Empress Dowager and the imperial court, the argument was made that the Boxers were rebels and that support from the imperial court came only from a few Manchu princes. Esherick concludes that the origin of the term "rebellion" was "purely political and opportunistic", but it has shown a remarkable staying power, particularly in popular accounts.\nA. yes B. no\nAnswer: The Boxer Rebellion took place in China in 1900. The Royal Air Force (RAF) was not established until April 1918, well after the Boxer Rebellion had ended. Therefore, it can be concluded that the RAF did not fight in the Boxer Rebellion. The correct answer is (B) no. So, the correct answer is B
